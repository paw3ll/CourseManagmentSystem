Starting:
	Pom.xml
		Created a parent section that turned the program into a child of the Spring Boot framework
		to be able to use all of its properties and be a Spring Boot application. Informs Maven what
		.jars to pull when you list dependencies.
		
		Created a dependencies section that listed the application as a web type application
		
Understanding:
	There is an embedded Tomcat server with the Spring Boot download.
	This allows the user a great convenience becauase they do not have to download the Tomcat server
	and install it and all of that process. They are able to hit the ground running. This also allows 
	the servlet container config to act as the application config.
	This allows the Spring Boot application to be a stand alone application, that is inharently easier
	to develop on and utalize.
		

The next unit we will be working on Starting a Spring Boot Application using Spring Initalizr, Spring Boot CLI and finally
STS IDE and then we will work on configuring the application.
Worked on Spring Groovy Script and creating hello world with it.

Connect Spring Boot application to SQL database using Spring Data JPA (Java Persistence API)
